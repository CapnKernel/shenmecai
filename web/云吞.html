<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In Hong Kong, wonton noodles are
usually served in steaming hot soup with shrimp wontons and garnished
with leafy vegetables. There are plenty of variations of this popular
Cantonese dish, with different toppings and garnsihes. For example
the soup and wontons in a separate bowl, the noodles being served
relatively dry, with the toppings and garnishes, dressed with sauce,
dipping the noodles in the soup to eat it.</P>
<P>There are four distinct features: First, the wontons are
predominantly <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prawn">prawn</A>,
with low amounts of pork mince, or no pork at all. Second,
aficionados will insist on fresh, smooth <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_noodles">thin
noodles</A> which are <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_dente"><I>al
dente</I></A>, free from the taste and odor which is characteristic
in many egg noodles when cooked. Third, the bouillon is light brown
(prepared from dried <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flounder">flounder</A>)
and is usually steaming hot. Lastly, <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garlic_chives">garlic
chives</A> are used as a garnish. The first two give the dish a wet
but crunchy or crispy mouthfeel. The last two give the dish a unique
bouquet.</P>
<P>In order to ensure that the noodles are perfectly al dente and
free from &quot;noodley&quot; taste, the cooking process and sequence
must be meticulously adhered to. The wonton is cooked first, and then
placed in the bowl. The noodles are <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanching_%28cooking%29">blanched</A>
for only 10 seconds, after which they are rinsed under cold water and
placed in the serving bowl. Piping hot <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouillon_%28broth%29">bouillon</A>
is then scooped into the bowl, on top of the wonton noodles. The
bouillon must be tasty, yet not so strong as to overpower the
delicate taste of the wonton and the noodles which it is meant to
accompany. Wonton is most popular in some China states.</P>
